This rule wraps another web server and provides LDAP and HTTPS support.

It's not intended to be used in production. It's intended to provide team
members with a way to test their code in a production-like environment. E.g. to
test whether your server makes use of LDAP credentials correctly.

Write this as a wrapper around another binary like so:

    apache_wrapper(
        name = "wrapped_server",
        binary = "//path/to:server_binary",
    )

Then you can run Apache and the wrapped binary like so:

    $ bazel run :wrapped_server

The wrapped binary can find the port that Apache is wrapping via the
APACHE_WRAPPED_PORT environment variable.

This rule assumes that you have a file at the root of the workspace called
"ldap.json". You can customize this path with the `--ldap_info` argument. The
JSON file has to have these three entries in it:

    {
        "ldap_bind_dn": "...",
        "ldap_url": "...",
        "ldap_password": "..."
    }

where the "..." values are replaced with the information to connect to an LDAP
server.

If the default ports of 7000 and 7500 are already taken, you can change them via
the `--https_port` and `--wrapped_port` arguments.
