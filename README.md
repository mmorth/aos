# Introduction

Welcome to AOS's main code repository. It contains two things:
* AOS ("Autonomous Operating System") is an open source event-loop based framework for realtime robotic systems. You can learn more about it [here](documentation/aos/docs/index.md).
* A collection of software useful for robots, particularly the kind used in the [First Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

Pleaes note: AOS moved here fairly recently and we are still cleaning up a few things, especially documentation.

# Contributing
All development of AOS is done on our gerrit instance at https://realtimeroboticsgroup.org/gerrit with github being a read-only mirror.  We are happy to add external contributors.  If you are interested, reach out to Austin Schuh and he will help you get access.  In case of disputes over if a patch should be taken or not, Austin has final say.

Git has support for adding Signed-off-by lines by using `git commit -s`, or you can setup a git commit hook to automatically sign off your commits.  [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15015894/git-add-signed-off-by-line-using-format-signoff-not-working) has instructions for how to do this if you are interested.
