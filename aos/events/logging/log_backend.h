//     Rather than burden the API for detecting when that is the case, we want
//     DetachedBufferWriter to be as efficient as it can at writing what given.
//  3) Some files are small and not updated frequently.  They need to be
//     flushed or we will lose data on power off.  It is most efficient to write
//     as much as we can aligned by kSector and then fall back to the non direct
//     method when it has been flushed.
