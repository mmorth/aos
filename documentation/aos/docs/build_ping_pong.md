# Getting Started

This page will walk through how to create a simple Ping/Pong application in AOS,
essentially from scratch.

## Building the Code

For purposes of this exercise, we will assume that you have cloned the
[aos][https://github.com/RealtimeRoboticsGroup/aos] repository. If you
have set up AOS as an external repository in
your own [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) workspace, then the main differences
should just be that you add Bazel dependencies with an `@aos`.

AOS nominally supports Debian Bookworm, although later versions of Debian and
Ubuntu 20.04+ should work to build the code.

After cloning AOS and installing Bazel, then you can confirm that the core
functionality is working by doing
```
bazel test //aos/events/...
```

Note that several tests may fail to run due to permissions issues, since they
will attempt to exercise some of AOS code related to setting realtime schedulers
and locking memory. You can resolve these by following the directions in
[Realtime System Configuration](#realtime-system-configuration).

At a minimum, `bazel test //aos/events:simulated_event_loop_test` should
reliably succeed.

Once you have the code building, you can start trying to write an application.
Note that this example will just be walking through replicating the existing
ping/pong processes that are defined in `//aos/events/`[^paths]. If you are unsure if
you are doing something wrong, you can compare your code to the code already in
the repository.

## Writing a Pair of Ping/Pong Applications

For this example, we will create a pair of applications where the `ping`
application will send an `aos.examples.Ping` message at a fixed period. The
`pong` application will listen for this message, and send an `aos.examples.Pong`
message in response. The ping application will listen for this message and print
to stderr whenever it gets a response.

We will do all our work in a new folder. Let us create a new top-level
`foo` folder in the repository (the exact name/path is unimportant).

To keep this example tractable, it functions in a "single-node" world. Most AOS
users actually operate in a multi-node world. This is discussed later.

<!-- TODO: link to said discussion. -->

### Defining FlatBuffer Messages

The FlatBuffer messages that our processes send/receive are effectively the API
of the processes themselves, and so we will start by defining them. FlatBuffer
messages are defined in `.fbs` files which define the schema for the message.
For details on how FlatBuffers themselves work, see the
[FlatBuffers website](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/).

For the Ping message, create a `ping.fbs` file with the following contents:

```
namespace aos.examples;

table Ping {
  value:int (id: 0);
  send_time:long (id: 1);
}

root_type Ping;
```

Stepping through what each line means:

```
namespace aos.examples;
```

This specifies that all following definitions will be in the `aos.examples`
namespace. For C++ code, this results in the generated flatbuffer code being in
the `aos::examples` namespace (as one would expect). Other languages translate
namespaces in different ways.

```
table Ping {
```

Defines the `Ping` table. Because this is in the `aos.examples` namespace, the
fully-qualified name of this table will be `aos.examples.Ping`.

```
  value:int (id: 0);
```

Defines a 32-bit signed integer field named `value` in the flatbuffer.
Since no default value is specified, the default default value
of 0 will be used. The `(id: 0)` specifies the unique ID that the
flatbuffer serialization will use for this field. The exact
value is generally unimportant, except that IDs must be unique,
IDs must start from zero and have no gaps (or else the flatbuffer compiler will
yell at you), and because IDs are used for serialization, if you ever change the
ID used for a field (or re-use the ID for a different field), you will break
backwards compatibility with old data.

Details about the scalar types available in FlatBuffers can be found
[here](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html) in the Types section.


```
  send_time:long (id: 1);
```

This defines a field named `send_time` that is a signed 64-bit integer.

```
}

root_type Pong;
```

The `root_type` declaration doesn't change any FlatBuffer serialization on its
own, but the root type for a schema will see some additional codegen. For AOS,
any table that is going to serve as a message must be the `root_type` of its
`.fbs` file (there is only one message per `.fbs` file in this example, and no
nested tables, so the issue is irrelevant here).

For the `aos.examples.Pong` message, we will create a `pong.fbs` that has
essentially the same structure:

```
namespace aos.examples;

table Pong {
  value:int (id: 0);
  initial_send_time:long (id: 1);
}

root_type Pong;
```

The final part of defining the FlatBuffer messages is defining Bazel targets to
actually do the codegen for the schemas. Since we have not yet created a BUILD
file for this new directory, we will create a new `BUILD` file with the
following contents:


```python
load("@com_github_google_flatbuffers//:build_defs.bzl", "flatbuffer_cc_library")

flatbuffer_cc_library(
    name = "ping_fbs",
    srcs = ["ping.fbs"],
    gen_reflections = 1,
)

flatbuffer_cc_library(
    name = "pong_fbs",
    srcs = ["pong.fbs"],
    gen_reflections = 1,
)
```

If we step through the interesting lines in the `BUILD` file:

```python
load("@com_github_google_flatbuffers//:build_defs.bzl", "flatbuffer_cc_library")
```

Imports the `flatbuffer_cc_library` build rule so that we have it available.

```python
flatbuffer_cc_library(
    name = "ping_fbs",
```

Defines a target (named `ping_fbs`) that will codegen a C++ library for the
specified `.fbs` file. This can then be depended on by C++ Bazel targets
directly.

```python
    srcs = ["ping.fbs"],
```

Specifies the `.fbs` file that we are generating code for.

```python
    gen_reflections = 1,
```

This turns on generation of the reflection schemas for the FlatBuffer file.
This results in a `.bfbs` file being generated that contains a FlatBuffer of
type `reflection.Schema` (defined in [reflection.fbs][reflection_fbs]).
This is required for FlatBuffer files that will be
used for AOS messages so that the AOS config can include reflection information.

For more details on the arguments available in the `flatbuffer_cc_library` rule,
see the [upstream FlatBuffers repository][flatbuffer_cc_library].

To confirm that you have successfully set up your FlatBuffer files and BUILD
targets, you can build the targets directly:

```bash
bazel build //foo:ping_fbs
```

This should generate a C++ header at `bazel-bin/foo/ping_generated.h`.

### Writing the AOS Config

Every system running AOS will need a configuration. The configuration is a
FlatBuffer message defined in
[configuration.fbs](https://github.com/RealtimeRoboticsGroup/aos/blob/main/aos/configuration.fbs).
Developers typically interact with the AOS config as a JSON file, which is then
parsed into a FlatBuffer by various pieces of tooling.

The primary role of the config is to define all of the message channels that
will exist. It also includes some top-level configuration information and a list
of processes ("applications") that will be run.

For this system we will create a file named `pingpong.json` that has
contents of:

```json
{
  "applications": [
    {
      "name": "ping"
    },
    {
      "name": "pong"
    }
  ],
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "/test",
      "type": "aos.examples.Ping",
      "frequency": 4500
    },
    {
      "name": "/test",
      "type": "aos.examples.Pong",
      "frequency": 4500
    }
  ],
  "imports": [
    "../aos/events/aos.json"
  ]
}
```

Going over the key lines:

```json
  "applications": [
    {
      "name": "ping"
    },
    {
      "name": "pong"
    }
  ],
```

This defines the set of applications running in the system.
Since we have nothing particularly complex going on, we only need to specify
the names of the applications. If, e.g., the name of the binary
 being run does not match the name of the application, then additional parameters are needed.

```json
    {
      "name": "/test",
      "type": "aos.examples.Ping",
      "frequency": 4500
    },
```

This defines a channel named `/test` with a type of `aos.examples.Ping` that
will see messages at rate of at most 4500 Hz. Note that the pair of name + type
must be unique per channel, but it is possible to both have multiple channels
with the same name but different types and channels with different names but the same types.
Note that the `type` field will always use the fully-qualified type name (i.e., it includes
the namespace). The frequency is a strict maximum---messages cannot be sent any faster.
See [Sent Too Fast](reference.md#sent-too-fast) for details on max frequencies.

There is also a `max_size` channel value that allows you to increase the allowable
size (in bytes) for messages sent on the channel.

<!-- TODO: Link to multi-node configuration. -->

```json
  "imports": [
    "../aos/events/aos.json"
  ]
```

This imports the `aos.json` config, which defines some common channels that are
potentially relevant for any AOS system. Note that imports are relative.

Next, we need to use the `aos_config` Bazel rule to generate the processed
config that can actually be used on a real system. Internally, the `aos_config`
rule is feeding the hand-written configurations through the `config_flattener`
which does a few things:

* Resolves all imports.
* Imports the message schemas for each channel into the config.
* Generates the resulting flattened config in multiple useful formats.

To do this, we add the following to our `BUILD` file:

```python
# Typically, this load() statement will go at the top of the file.
load("//aos:config.bzl", "aos_config")

aos_config(
    name = "pingpong_config",
    src = "pingpong.json",
    flatbuffers = [
        ":ping_fbs",
        ":pong_fbs",
    ],
    deps = ["//aos/events:aos_config"],
)
```

In particular, note that the list of `flatbuffers` must include _all_ the
FlatBuffers used by the config (so that we can get at the schemas generated by
the `gen_reflections` argument in the previous section). We also have a `deps`
entry for the config that we are importing.

If we build this config

```bash
bazel build //foo:pingpong_config
```

We will see that it generates three output files

```
bazel-bin/foo/pingpong_config.json
bazel-bin/foo/pingpong_config.stripped.json
bazel-bin/foo/pingpong_config.bfbs
```

The suffixes of each file mean:

* `.json`: This is the full resulting config, in human-readable JSON.
* `.stripped.json`: This is the flattened config, but with the message schemas
  removed. This is not used by any application code, but can be convenient for
  debugging since it is a much smaller file than the full configs.
* `.bfbs`: The full resulting config, but serialized as a binary FlatBuffer.
  This contains exactly the same information as the `.json`, but is much
  smaller and is much faster to parse.

Both the `.json` and `.bfbs` files can be used by applications, but most
applications will attempt to use the `.bfbs` file if present due to the lower
startup penalty from not having to read a massive JSON file.

### Writing the Ping Application

Now that we have the message types and channels all defined, we have the basic
structure that we need in order to actually write our applications, starting
with `ping`.  To do this, we will end up creating four files:

* `ping_lib.h`: The header file for the application itself.
* `ping_lib.cc`: The source file implementing our application.
* `ping.cc`: The file with `main` that will start up the `ping` application.
* `ping_lib_test.cc`: Contains the unit tests for the code in `ping_lib.*`.tests

The contents of `ping_lib.h` will be:

```cpp
#ifndef FOO_PING_LIB_H_
#define FOO_PING_LIB_H_

#include "aos/events/event_loop.h"
#include "foo/ping_generated.h"
#include "foo/pong_generated.h"

namespace aos {

// Class which sends out a Ping message every X ms, and times the response.
class Ping {
 public:
  Ping(EventLoop *event_loop);

 private:
  // Sends out the ping message with an incrementing count.
  void SendPing();

  // Receives the reply and measures the latency.
  void HandlePong(const examples::Pong &pong);

  aos::EventLoop *event_loop_;
  aos::Sender<examples::Ping> sender_;
  // Timer handle which sends the Ping message.
  aos::TimerHandler *timer_handle_;
  // Number of pings sent.
  int count_ = 0;
};

}  // namespace aos

#endif  // FOO_PING_LIB_H_
```

And `ping_lib.cc` will be:
```cpp
#include "foo/ping_lib.h"

#include "aos/json_to_flatbuffer.h"
#include "absl/flags/flag.h"
#include "absl/log/log.h"
#include "absl/log/check.h"

ABSL_FLAG(int32_t, sleep_ms, 10, "Time to sleep between pings");

namespace aos {

namespace chrono = std::chrono;

Ping::Ping(EventLoop *event_loop)
    : event_loop_(event_loop),
      sender_(event_loop_->MakeSender<examples::Ping>("/test")) {
  timer_handle_ = event_loop_->AddTimer([this]() { SendPing(); });
  timer_handle_->set_name("ping");

  event_loop_->MakeWatcher(
      "/test", [this](const examples::Pong &pong) { HandlePong(pong); });

  event_loop_->OnRun([this]() {
    timer_handle_->Schedule(event_loop_->monotonic_now(),
                            chrono::milliseconds(FLAGS_sleep_ms));
  });
}

void Ping::SendPing() {
  ++count_;
  aos::Sender<examples::Ping>::Builder builder = sender_.MakeBuilder();
  examples::Ping::Builder ping_builder = builder.MakeBuilder<examples::Ping>();
  ping_builder.add_value(count_);
  ping_builder.add_send_time(
      event_loop_->monotonic_now().time_since_epoch().count());
  builder.CheckOk(builder.Send(ping_builder.Finish()));
}

void Ping::HandlePong(const examples::Pong &pong) {
  const aos::monotonic_clock::time_point monotonic_send_time(
      chrono::nanoseconds(pong.initial_send_time()));
  const aos::monotonic_clock::time_point monotonic_now =
      event_loop_->monotonic_now();

  const chrono::nanoseconds round_trip_time =
      monotonic_now - monotonic_send_time;

  if (pong.value() == count_) {
    LOG(INFO) << "Elapsed time " << round_trip_time.count() << " ns "
              << FlatbufferToJson(&pong);
  }
}

}  // namespace aos
```

Stepping over some of the more relevant code:

In `ping_lib.h`:

```cpp
  #include "foo/ping_generated.h"
  #include "foo/pong_generated.h"
```

These are the generated headers for each of the FlatBuffer messages that we
defined. For a `.fbs` file named `foo.fbs`, the resulting header will be named
`foo_generated.h`.

```cpp
  Ping(EventLoop *event_loop);
```

By convention, the top-level class for an AOS application will take, as the
first argument to its constructor, an `aos::EventLoop*`. The
[EventLoop](reference.md#eventloop-interface) will be
used for all the application's interactions with the rest of the AOS system.

In `ping_lib.cc`:

```cpp
ABSL_FLAG(int32_t, sleep_ms, 10, "Time to sleep between pings");
```

This creates a command-line flag `--sleep_ms` which can be accessed in the code
as `FLAGS_sleep_ms`, using the [gflags](https://gflags.github.io/gflags/)
library. `gflags` is the default command-line flag management library used
throughout AOS, although for testability we generally discourage using flags
for configuration of normal application behavior.


```cpp
      sender_(event_loop_->MakeSender<examples::Ping>("/test")) {
```

Here we create a sender for the `aos.examples.Ping` message on the `/test`
channel. Senders need to be created before the EventLoop starts running. The
`MakeSender` call will check for whether the requested channel actually exists
in the AOS configuration, and die if no such channel is available. There is a
`TryMakeSender` available for those situations where it makes sense to gate
logic on the existence of a channel.

```cpp
  timer_handle_ = event_loop_->AddTimer([this]() { SendPing(); });
  timer_handle_->set_name("ping");
```

This creates a timer (and gives it a name, which is optional but helpful for
debugging). Timers in AOS call callbacks (in this case a lambda that calls
`SendPing();`) at requested times/intervals per the `Schedule` call (which is
done below).

```cpp
  event_loop_->MakeWatcher(
      "/test", [this](const examples::Pong &pong) { HandlePong(pong); });
```

This sets up the `HandlePong()` method to be called every time a new message is
received on the `/test` `aos.examples.Pong` channel.

```cpp
  event_loop_->OnRun([this]() {
    timer_handle_->Schedule(event_loop_->monotonic_now(),
                            chrono::milliseconds(FLAGS_sleep_ms));
  });
```

This makes it so that, once execution starts on the EventLoop, the timer (which
calls `SendPing`) will start getting called at the current time
(`event_loop_->monotonic_now()`) and every `FLAGS_sleep_ms` milliseconds
thereafter.

`OnRun` can be called many times to register many handlers to be called when the
`EventLoop` starts. The `OnRun` handler allows you to delay certain actions
until execution is "actually" happening. In many real situations, there is
little practical difference between just doing all your setup in the constructor
of your class vs. in the `OnRun`. However, in situations where you do
long-running initialization work in your constructor (e.g., you need to
pre-seed a complex solver), it can be desirable to delay certain work until the
EventLoop actually starts running. There are also some subtle differences in
guarantees provided by the EventLoop when it is running vs. when it is not.

<!-- TODO: Link to explain those "subtle differences" -->

```cpp
void Ping::SendPing() {
  ++count_;
  aos::Sender<examples::Ping>::Builder builder = sender_.MakeBuilder();
  examples::Ping::Builder ping_builder = builder.MakeBuilder<examples::Ping>();
  ping_builder.add_value(count_);
  ping_builder.add_send_time(
      event_loop_->monotonic_now().time_since_epoch().count());
  builder.CheckOk(builder.Send(ping_builder.Finish()));
}
```

Here we actually send out our Ping message. We use the various `MakeBuilder`
methods and the resulting builders to construct a `Ping` message with a count
and current time. We then actually send it out, checking to ensure that there
were no errors encountered while attempting to send the message.

See [FlatBuffers](flatbuffers.md) for more details on working with FlatBuffers in
AOS.

```cpp
void Ping::HandlePong(const examples::Pong &pong) {
  const aos::monotonic_clock::time_point monotonic_send_time(
      chrono::nanoseconds(pong.initial_send_time()));
  const aos::monotonic_clock::time_point monotonic_now =
      event_loop_->monotonic_now();

  const chrono::nanoseconds round_trip_time =
      monotonic_now - monotonic_send_time;

  if (pong.value() == count_) {
    LOG(INFO) << "Elapsed time " << round_trip_time.count() << " ns "
              << FlatbufferToJson(&pong);
  }
}
```

Here we handle each incoming Pong message, calculate the round-trip time and
print it out only if the Pong message actually corresponds to our most
recent Ping. Note that the `LOG(INFO)` is using
[glog](https://github.com/google/glog#user-guide), a logging library used
extensively throughout the AOS codebase.

Finally, in order to build this we need a `cc_library` entry in our BUILD file:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "ping_lib",
    srcs = ["ping_lib.cc"],
    hdrs = ["ping_lib.h"],
    deps = [
        ":ping_fbs",
        ":pong_fbs",
        "//aos:json_to_flatbuffer",
        "//aos/events:event_loop",
        "@com_google_absl//absl/flags:flag",
        "@com_google_absl//absl/log","@com_google_absl//absl/log:check",
    ],
)
```

### Writing Tests for the Ping application

Because we are good Software Engineers, we must now write tests for the
application we just created. In AOS, because of how the EventLoop interface is
designed, we can readily create a simulated environment where all events and
clocks progress deterministically.

To test the `Ping` class, we can write a `ping_lib_test.cc` using
[gtest](http://google.github.io/googletest/) that looks like:

```cpp
#include "foo/ping_lib.h"

#include "aos/events/simulated_event_loop.h"
#include "aos/testing/path.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

namespace aos::testing {

namespace chrono = std::chrono;

class PingPongTest : public ::testing::Test {
 public:
  PingPongTest()
      // Using ArtifactPath to account for the file structure in the Bazel test
      // environment, read the AOS config generated by aos_config bazel rule
      // (note how the name of this config file is identical to the name of the
      // aos_config rule, not to the name of the hand-written file.
      : config_(aos::configuration::ReadConfig(
            ArtifactPath("foo/pingpong_config.json"))),
        // Construct a SimulatedEventLoopFactory according to the config. This
        // factory will handle coordinating the simulation.
        event_loop_factory_(&config_.message()),
        // Actually create the EventLoop that the Ping application will use. We
        // pass in a name that should match the name that is used in the AOS
        // config (although doesn't strictly have to).
        ping_event_loop_(event_loop_factory_.MakeEventLoop("ping")),
        ping_(ping_event_loop_.get()),
        // Create a separate "test" EventLoop (the name doesn't typically
        // matter) which will be used for interacting with the Ping application.
        test_event_loop_(event_loop_factory_.MakeEventLoop("test")) {}

  // Config and factory.
  // The factory creates connected event loops.  Each application needs
  // a separate event loop (because you can't send a message to yourself in a
  // single event loop).  The created event loops can then send messages to each
  // other and trigger callbacks to be called, or fetchers to receive data.
  aos::FlatbufferDetachedBuffer<aos::Configuration> config_;
  SimulatedEventLoopFactory event_loop_factory_;

  // Event loop and application for Ping.
  std::unique_ptr<EventLoop> ping_event_loop_;
  Ping ping_;

  // Event loop for running our tests.
  std::unique_ptr<EventLoop> test_event_loop_;
};

// Tests that the ping application sends a bunch of pings with unique counters.
TEST_F(PingPongTest, SendsPings) {
  // We keep this test relatively straightforward--we just check that the Ping
  // application is sending out Ping messages with counters that continually
  // increment by one. In order to do this, we use the test EventLoop that we
  // craeted to create a Watcher on the appropriate channel and check each Ping
  // message as it comes in.
  int last_count = 0;
  test_event_loop_->MakeWatcher(
      "/test", [&last_count](const aos::examples::Ping &ping) {
        EXPECT_EQ(ping.value(), last_count + 1)
            << "Count was expected to increment by exactly 1.";
        last_count = ping.value();
      });
  // RunFor runs all the EventLoop's in the factory simulataneously,
  // coordinating events and messages on all the channels.
  event_loop_factory_.RunFor(chrono::seconds(10));
  // At the end, ensure that we actually got Ping messages--if we don't test
  // this, then we could end up never receiving *any* messages and the rest of
  // the test would pass.
  EXPECT_LT(0, last_count) << "Expected at least 1 Ping message.";
}
}  // namespace aos::testing
```

Let us know if having the comments explaining the code inline works better or
worse than having it broken out into its own text like the previous code
snippets.

And then, in order to actually execute the test, we need to create a `cc_test`
target in our BUILD file:

```
cc_test(
    name = "ping_lib_test",
    srcs = ["ping_lib_test.cc"],
    data = [":pingpong_config.json"],
    deps = [
        ":ping_lib",
        "//aos/events:simulated_event_loop",
        "//aos/testing:googletest",
        "//aos/testing:path",
    ],
)
```

Note that for files that are used by the test when it is executing (namely, the
config file), we need to add them to the `data` entry of the test rule rather
than to the `deps` (which are the C++ dependencies needed by the compiler).

We can then run the test by doing

```bash
bazel test //foo:ping_lib_test
```

### Writing the Ping main()

In order to create a `ping` binary that can actually be run on a real system, we
will create a `ping.cc`:

```cpp
#include "aos/configuration.h"
#include "foo/ping_lib.h"
#include "aos/events/shm_event_loop.h"
#include "aos/init.h"
#include "absl/flags/flag.h"

// Provide a --config flag that can be used to point to the config that the
// application will use. Generally defaulted to the actual path that will be
// used on the real system (most applications default to a name of
// aos_config.json, by convention).
ABSL_FLAG(std::string, config, "foo/pingpong_config.json", "Path to the config.");

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  // Various common initialization steps, including command line flag parsing.
  aos::InitGoogle(&argc, &argv);

  aos::FlatbufferDetachedBuffer<aos::Configuration> config =
      aos::configuration::ReadConfig(FLAGS_config);

  // Create a shared-memory based EventLoop using the provided config.
  // This is currently the only EventLoop implementation for using on realtime
  // systems.
  aos::ShmEventLoop event_loop(&config.message());

  aos::Ping ping(&event_loop);

  // Actually run the EventLoop. This will block until event_loop.Exit() is
  // called or we receive a signal to exit (e.g., a Ctrl-C on the command line).
  event_loop.Run();

  return 0;
}
```

Essentially all of this code is boilerplate that you will see in most binaries.
There are sometimes minor variations, but ideally as much code as possible is in
the actual library code where it can be tested.

We will also need a `cc_binary` bazel target to build:

```python
cc_binary(
    name = "ping",
    srcs = ["ping.cc"],
    data = [":pingpong_config"],
    deps = [
        ":ping_lib",
        "//aos:configuration",
        "//aos:init",
        "//aos/events:shm_event_loop",
        "@com_google_absl//absl/flags:flag",
    ],
)
```

Note that we add a `data` dependency on the AOS config. This makes it so that
when we do `bazel run //foo:ping`, bazel will ensure that the AOS config is
built and available to the `ping` binary at runtime.

### Defining the Pong application

We will not go over Pong in as much detail, and instead just provided the
suggested contents of the `pong_lib.h`, `pong_lib.cc`, and `pong.cc`:

`pong_lib.h`:

```cpp
#ifndef FOO_PONG_LIB_H_
#define FOO_PONG_LIB_H_

#include "aos/events/event_loop.h"
#include "foo/pong_generated.h"

namespace aos {

// Class which replies to a Ping message with a Pong message immediately.
class Pong {
 public:
  Pong(EventLoop *event_loop);

 private:
  EventLoop *event_loop_;
  aos::Sender<examples::Pong> sender_;
  int32_t last_value_ = 0;
  int32_t last_send_time_ = 0;
};

}  // namespace aos

#endif  // FOO_PONG_LIB_H_
```

`pong_lib.cc`:

```cpp
#include "foo/pong_lib.h"

#include "aos/events/event_loop.h"
#include "foo/ping_generated.h"

namespace aos {

Pong::Pong(EventLoop *event_loop)
    : event_loop_(event_loop),
      sender_(event_loop_->MakeSender<examples::Pong>("/test")) {
  event_loop_->MakeWatcher("/test", [this](const examples::Ping &ping) {
    last_value_ = ping.value();
    last_send_time_ = ping.send_time();
    aos::Sender<examples::Pong>::Builder builder = sender_.MakeBuilder();
    examples::Pong::Builder pong_builder =
        builder.MakeBuilder<examples::Pong>();
    pong_builder.add_value(ping.value());
    pong_builder.add_initial_send_time(ping.send_time());
    builder.CheckOk(builder.Send(pong_builder.Finish()));
  });
}

}  // namespace aos
```

`pong.cc`:

Should be identical to `ping.cc`, except for including a using `pong_lib.h` and
`Pong` instead of `ping_lib.h` and `Ping`. Making these changes is left as an
exercise to the reader.

And the following BUILD file entries should be created:

```python
cc_library(
    name = "pong_lib",
    srcs = ["pong_lib.cc"],
    hdrs = ["pong_lib.h"],
    deps = [
        ":ping_fbs",
        ":pong_fbs",
        "//aos/events:event_loop",
    ],
)

cc_binary(
    name = "pong",
    srcs = ["pong.cc"],
    data = [":pingpong_config"],
    deps = [
        ":pong_lib",
        "//aos:configuration",
        "//aos:init",
        "//aos/events:shm_event_loop",
        "@com_google_absl//absl/flags:flag",
    ],
)
```

### Running our applications "for real"

We are now in a state where we have all the pieces we need to actually run the
ping and pong applications. We just need to get everything coordinated to
actually run them. Note that in a real system, you would typically have
some build rules and scripts that manage deploying everything---here,
we will just manually build and run things to get them working.

Let us open three separate terminals, and in the first two run:

1. `bazel run //foo:ping`
2. `bazel run //foo:pong`

We should immediately see the `ping` terminal printing to `stderr` for every
pong message it is receiving. If we want to actually see the message flow
itself, we can use the `aos_dump` utility to view raw messages on individual
channels in the third terminal:

```bash
# Ensure that aos_dump and the config are both built and in the Bazel cache.
bazel build //aos:aos_dump //foo:pingpong_config
bazel-bin/aos/aos_dump --config=bazel-bin/foo/pingpong_config.json
```

`aos_dump` with no extra arguments (beyond the config, which we only need
because we are in a special case) will print a list of available channels. You
can either manually copy the channels or just use tab completion to specify a
channel to watch:

```
bazel-bin/aos/aos_dump --config=bazel-bin/foo/pingpong_config.json /test aos.examples.Ping
```

And you now have a simple, running, AOS application! There are lots of things
that this hasn't covered, but hopefully it has provided a basic overview of how
to get things working.

## Realtime System Configuration

In order to be able to run all the AOS tests, as well as to be able to work with
running realtime code locally (or on a test target), you should add the
following lines to `/etc/security/limits.d/rt.conf`, replacing "USERNAME"
with the username you're running under.  You'll probably need to do this as
root, e.g., `sudo nano /etc/security/limits.d/rt.conf`
```
USERNAME - nice -20
USERNAME - rtprio 95
USERNAME - memlock unlimited
```

If you prefer to just run a single command, then
```
echo -e "${USER} - nice -20\n${USER} - rtprio 95\n${USER} - memlock unlimited" | sudo tee /etc/security/limits.d/rt.conf
```
should also work.

In order for these changes to take effect, you will need to reboot your machine
(strictly speaking, you only need a new session, which can be done by, e.g.,
logging out and logging back in, or by creating a new ssh session). Confirm that
the limits have taken effect using `ulimit -a`.
